### Key Concepts and Challenges
1. **Data Loading and Cleaning**: Load the retail sales dataset.
2. **Descriptive Statistics**: Calculate basic statistics (mean, median, mode, standard deviation).
3. **Time Series Analysis**: Analyze sales trends over time using time series techniques.
4. **Customer and Product Analysis**: Analyze customer demographics and purchasing behavior.
5. **Visualization**: Present insights through bar charts, line plots, and heatmaps.
6. **Recommendations**: Provide actionable recommendations based on the EDA.

### Learning Objectives
- Gain hands-on experience in data cleaning and exploratory data analysis.
- Develop skills in interpreting descriptive statistics and time series analysis.
- Learn to use data visualization for effective communication of insights.
