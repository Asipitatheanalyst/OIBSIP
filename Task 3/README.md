# Customer Segmentation Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using clustering techniques to analyze spending patterns and purchase behaviors. By leveraging customer data, we aim to uncover insights that can help businesses optimize marketing strategies, personalize customer experiences, and improve overall sales performance.

## 📂 Data Source
The dataset used in this project contains customer demographic information, spending habits, and purchase behavior. The data includes features such as:
- Annual income
- Spending on various product categories
- Purchase behaviors across different channels (Web, Catalog, Store)

## 🛠 Tools Used
- **Python** (for data analysis and visualization)
- **Pandas** (for data manipulation and cleaning)
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** (for data visualization)
- **Scikit-learn** (for clustering analysis)

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation
1. **Handling Missing Values:** Checked for and addressed any missing data.
2. **Feature Engineering:** Created new features relevant to customer segmentation.
3. **Data Normalization:** Scaled numerical features for optimal clustering performance.
4. **Outlier Detection:** Identified and managed outliers to improve cluster accuracy.

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
### 1️⃣ Average Spending per Cluster
- A **bar chart** visualizes the average spending per cluster across different product categories.
- Key insights show variations in spending habits among different customer groups.

### 2️⃣ Purchase Behavior by Cluster
- Another **bar chart** represents purchase behavior across different clusters.
- It highlights how customers prefer different purchase channels (Web, Catalog, Store).

### 3️⃣ Customer Distribution by Annual Income and Spending Score
- A **scatter plot** helps visualize customer segmentation based on annual income and spending scores.
- It showcases distinct groups with varying purchasing power and spending habits.

## 📈 Results & Findings
- **Cluster 0:** Low spenders, prefer in-store purchases.
- **Cluster 1:** Moderate spenders, balance between online and in-store purchases.
- **Cluster 2:** High spenders, predominantly purchase via catalogs and online platforms.
- **Cluster 3:** Luxury buyers, high spenders across all product categories.

## 💡 Recommendations
- **Targeted Marketing:** Design personalized marketing campaigns based on customer clusters.
- **Promotions & Discounts:** Offer targeted promotions to increase engagement and sales.
- **Product Recommendations:** Use clustering insights to suggest relevant products.
- **Enhanced Customer Experience:** Improve service strategies tailored to each customer segment.
